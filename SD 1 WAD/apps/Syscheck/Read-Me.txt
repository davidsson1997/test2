sysCheck v1.6.2 by Erik Spyder


Homebrew application which does several checks on installed IOS and custom IOS:
	- IOS Stub;
	- Fake signature (aka Trucha Bug);
	- ES_DiVerify (aka ES_Identify);
	- Flash Access;
	- NAND Access;
	- Boot2 Access;
	- USB 2.0.

sysCheck generates a report on the root of the SD card (sd:/sysCheck.csv).
