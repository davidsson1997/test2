	<long_description>The Homebrew Browser allows you to download the latest homebrew applications and games all through your Wii. You don't need to take your SD card out. You don't even need a computer! You can also delete homebrew you no longer want.

No more dead links, no more extracting files, no more finding out that the homebrew application doesn't include an icon.png and meta.xml in the zip file! 

Icons:
Green Tick - You have the latest version of that homebrew application installed.
Yellow Question Mark - You might not have the latest version of that homebrew application installed.

Controls:
A Button = Click Button
B Button = Cancel Download or Extracting
Hold B button - Move the Wiimote up and down to scroll through the list quickly
D Pad Left/Right = Change category
D Pad Up/Down = Scroll up and down the list slowly
Minus/Plus Button = Delete/Remove/Add application to download/delete queue
Home Button = Menu
Hold Home Button down = Return to loader
